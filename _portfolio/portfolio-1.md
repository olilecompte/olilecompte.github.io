Transradial amputation is a major upper amputation involving the removal of the hand and part of the forearm. People who have undergone this surgical procedure are affected in their ability to interact with their environment through grasping. The development of robotic prostheses attempts to provide these individuals with a device that, with appropriate training, offers dexterous action capabilities of a level comparable to those available to a person with intact arms or hands. Myoelectric prostheses occupy an important place in this research, as they enable users to communicate their movement intentions to a robotic prosthesis without the inherent risk of injury associated with the repeated use of non-motorized alternatives. However, 40 % of users tend to abandon these assistive devices, attributing this decision in part to the lack of restoration of sensory pathways, which significantly impedes the execution of voluntary movements due to increased cognitive effort during use and reduced confidence in the prosthesis. Both researchers and users agree that sensory feedback is one of the main missing features of commercial prostheses.

The vast majority of current research focusing on the restoration of sensory perception proposes strategies aimed at including tactile feedback, i.e. providing awareness of the body's external surface. However, few address the integration of feedback relating to hand posture (proprioceptive perception). Yet this modality is relevant when implemented appropriately, since it improves success rates in movement execution and establishes sense of agency, a relationship between movement intention and sensory feedback that promotes user acceptance of the technology.

A few interesting avenues have been explored to develop proprioceptive feedback strategies, often using sensory substitution techniques or attempting to recreate the physiology involved in somatosensory perceptions through biomimetic approaches. However, limited efforts are being made to develop alternatives aimed at maximizing the user's interpretation of the conveyed proprioceptive information, while remaining non-invasive. Adjustments towards such an approach would have the potential to substantially encourage the adoption of myoelectric prostheses by minimizing the problems associated with their use, such as high cognitive load and low controllability when performing grasping tasks, especially without the contribution of visual inputs.

The aim of this researchis to investigate whether a novel strategy involving Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), which allows for interaction with the peripheral nervous system non-invasively via electrodes applied to the skin surface, has the potential to offer proprioceptive feedback. Such a framework circumvents many of the technical difficulties inherent in the induction of proprioceptive percepts and provides an interesting bioinspired compromise between the concepts of soft embodiment and hard embodiment, two complementary alternatives for promoting the integration of artificial limbs.
