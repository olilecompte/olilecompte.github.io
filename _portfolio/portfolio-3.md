In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply of personal protective equipment, and in particular surgical masks, promises to be a challenge over the coming weeks and months. Healthcare workers and those providing essential services are the first to be affected, but the latest government recommendations also advise the general public to wear masks when travelling, if necessary. It is essential to find rapid, local solutions to meet the need for protective masks. With this challenge, the initiative aims to mobilise the student community and the Estrie community to respond locally to this need through the know-how of local suppliers and manufacturers.
