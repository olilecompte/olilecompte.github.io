Winter conditions, characterized by the presence of ice and snow on the ground, are more likely to lead to road accidents. This paper presents an experimental proof of concept of a collision avoidance algorithm for vehicles evolving in low adhesion conditions, implemented on a 1/5th scale car platform. In the proposed approach, a model-based estimator first processes the high-dimensional sensors data of the IMU, LIDAR and encoders to estimate physically relevant vehicle and ground conditions parameters such as the inertial velocity of the vehicle v, the friction coefficient µ, the cohesion c and the internal shear angle ϕ. Then, a data-driven predictor is trained to predict the optimal maneuver to perform in the situation characterized by the estimated parameters. Experiments show that it is possible to 1) produce a real-time estimate of the relevant ground parameters, and 2) determine an optimal collision avoidance maneuver based on the estimated parameters. -->
